const FunctionStyling = `
Function Styling:
- Always use arrow functions
- Always use objects as arguments (makes method more flexible)
- Always add an interface explicity called 'IOptions' when defining the function arguments. Do not use anything other than than this exact spelling 'IOptions' when defining the interface.
- When an argument has explict options, always use an enum to define the options.

\`\`\`typescript
// src/utils/greeting.ts

enum TimeOfDay {
  Morning = 'morning',
  Afternoon = 'afternoon',
  Evening = 'evening',
}

interface IOptions {
  name: string;
  timeOfDay?: TimeOfDay;
}

export const createGreeting = ({ name, timeOfDay = 'morning' }: IOptions): string => {
  // Ensure name is properly formatted
  const formattedName = name.trim().charAt(0).toUpperCase() + name.slice(1).toLowerCase();

  return \`Good \${timeOfDay}, \${formattedName}!\`;
};
\`\`\`
